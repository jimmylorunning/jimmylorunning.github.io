  <h1 class="post-title">Jekyll & Hyde</h1>
  <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2015</span>
  <p>If you&#39;re a longtime reader (as in, the 2 months that this blog has been in existence), you may have noticed some changes. That&#39;s because I just changed blogging platforms from WordPress to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<h3>Why Change?</h3>

<p>In January, I was learning some new things (Rails, Ruby, Agile, etc.) and I had no time to customize a blog the way I liked it. Nevertheless, I needed some place to document what I&#39;ve learned and connect with people. So I decided to put up a blog as quickly as possible. The only requirement was that it required almost no time to set up. I was already familiar with WordPress, and have set several WordPress blogs up before. So I set it up, downloaded a free theme, and voila! I was in business.</p>

<p>Two and a half months later, I still like my blog a lot, but it seemed cluttered. I start noticing a lot of the other blogs I admired were beautifully minimalistic. The content was front and center. Most of these blogs were hosted on either Ghost, Medium, or GitHub Pages. I decided to look into these options.</p>

<h3>Why GitHub Pages?</h3>

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is hosted on GitHub. You automatically get one site per GitHub account, and when you push any changes to it, it gets updated. No further work needed! I was attracted mostly to the convenience of updating the blog where I would update my other code--in my text editor. It reminded me of the early days when the internet was just a bunch of static HTML pages, and I&#39;d log into the server to edit my HTML files directly.</p>

<h3>Why Jekyll?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll behind the scenes, so in addition to supporting regular HTML content, theyâ€™re also a great way to host your Jekyll-powered website for free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jekyll is so cool! With it, I can write all my posts within my text editor using beautiful <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/">Markdown</a> instead of ugly HTML or dealing with buggy WYSIWYG interfaces! GitHub Pages and Jekyll provides all the advantages of a static site (speed, simplicity) with all the advantages of a dynamic site (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY-ness</a>). Every time you push the site, Jekyll generates all the static pages for you based on the templates and code you&#39;ve written. So despite the fact that it&#39;s a static site, if you want to change the layout or colors or even functionality of your site, you can do it in just one place.</p>

<p>Jekyll works with regular HTML pages too, so I didn&#39;t have to convert all my old posts to Markdown.</p>

<h3>Setting it up</h3>

<p>There&#39;s nothing that technically extraordinary about my set-up that I need to write a whole blog post about it. I followed <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/">this tutorial</a>, but instead of only using <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">Poole</a>, I also used a Poole theme called <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde</a>. The difference? Poole isn&#39;t exactly a theme; it comes with all types of default settings on top of Jekyll to help bootstrap you so that you have a solid foundation to build upon. Hyde, on the other hand, <i>is</i> a theme and is built on top of Poole.</p>

<p>The second tutorial I used was <a href="http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/">this blog post</a> which helped me implement tags.</p>

<h3>Downsides</h3>

<p>The only downside is that I&#39;ve now lost all of the great comments you&#39;ve left on my blog. I still <i>have</i> them, of course. But they are no longer on this version of the blog for everyone to see. But since I&#39;ve implemented comments using <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, it will be pretty easy for you to leave comments on this site from here on out. You don&#39;t even need a Disqus account, as you can use OAuth to log in through Twitter or any of the other social networks.</p>
