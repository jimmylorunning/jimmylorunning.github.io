  <h1 class="post-title">Learning Roadmap</h1>
  <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2015</span>
  <p>One of the hardest things about self-guided learning is coming up with a disciplined curriculum of some sort. School is good for giving you some kind of structure in which to learn, but when you&#39;re learning on your own, you can go in any direction, which can be good and bad. When you don&#39;t know a lot, you may not even know what is worth learning and what isn&#39;t. It&#39;s really easy to end up learning &quot;spastically&quot; -- by which I mean, I&#39;ll learn a little bit of this until I see something shiny over here and then I&#39;ll learn that before I finish learning this, etc. Meanwhile maybe there&#39;s something else that is super important to what your end-goal is, but since you didn&#39;t read the right blog posts, you never even find out about it... the proverbial &quot;things you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>So it&#39;s important to start with a rough roadmap, and re-assess that roadmap regularly to see what spots you&#39;re missing. Here is my current roadmap:
<ul>
    <li>take the EdX.org <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-part-2-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-2x">Software as a Service Part 2</a> class. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x">Part 1</a> was super helpful in terms of learning basic Ruby/Rails, testing and agile practices. Part 2 focuses on more advanced Rails topics as well as working with legacy code. I am currently in week 2 of this class, which ends in mid-February.</li>
    <li>continue writing an app per week, with the following caveats:
<ul>
    <li>I want to learn at least one new thing per app. currently it&#39;s pretty hard <em>not</em> to learn one new thing, as I know relatively little. But as I learn more, I will probably want more specific goals like &quot;learn to make an API for my app&quot; or &quot;learn to write a simple gem&quot;.</li>
    <li>Since I am also taking the EdX SaaS class, on weeks where my SaaS homework is pretty involved, I can substitute that homework assignment for my weekly app</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://leveluprails.com/">Level UP Rails</a> -- I heard about this curriculum through the Ruby Rogues podcast episode <a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/190-rr-apprenticeship-with-joseph-mastey-and-jill-lynch-of-enova">&quot;Apprenticeship with Joseph Mastey and Jill Lynch of Enova&quot;</a> where Joseph talks about implementing an apprenticeship program at his company for onboarding new hires who show a lot of potential but who may not be as technically proficient. These apprentices spend the first few months just learning the company&#39;s stack, codebase, and a lot of other basic skills. Joseph also mentioned that the curriculum that he designed is now open source! It&#39;s available at <a href="https://leveluprails.com/">https://leveluprails.com/</a>. So far I&#39;m really enjoying this curriculum. It provides just enough guidance and links about each topic so that you know what you should learn, without providing too much more. Then it&#39;s your responsibility to Google it if you want to know more. There are also exercises at the end of each section. I also find the way the exercise titles are phrased to be amusing... I&#39;m not sure if this was a conscious decision but they&#39;re phrased to sound like unit test describe blocks..., for example &quot;Knows what ports are and can use netstat to find them&quot;. You can follow <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/level-up-rails">my progress on github</a>, where I&#39;ll record my answers to the exercises as well as whatever personal notes I want to remember for later.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.poodr.com/">Read Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby</a> by Sandi Metz - this is a great book so far. If you haven&#39;t already, go watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sandi+metz">Sandi Metz&#39;s talks</a> on YouTube. I&#39;ve learned so much from her.</li>
    <li>Continue to blog at least once a week.</li>
</ul>
Those are my top priorities. And here are some of my lesser goals that would be wonderful to accomplish if I can find the time:
<ul>
    <li>read <a href="http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/JavaScript_Enlightenment.pdf">JS Enlightenment</a></li>
    <li>read <a href="https://www.justinweiss.com/book/">Practicing Rails</a></li>
    <li>learn a JavaScript framework (Ember? Backbone? Angular? Meteor?)</li>
</ul>
Social or career oriented goals:
<ul>
    <li>Continue to attend meetups / hackathons</li>
    <li>Create my resume webpage</li>
    <li>Make some business cards</li>
</ul>
Non programming related:
<ul>
    <li>ride the <a href="http://streetcar.atlantaga.gov/">Atlanta Streetcar</a> which just opened up about a month ago.</li>
    <li>go to the <a href="http://www.thekingcenter.org/">Martin Luther King Center</a> I&#39;ve lived within 2 miles from the MLK center, drive by it all the time, and yet I&#39;ve never visited. There&#39;s no excuse for that!</li>
</ul></p>
