          SaaS Legacy Homework 2: Lessons Learned
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2015</span>

      <p>This week&#39;s <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-part-2-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-2x">SaaS homework</a> has been the most elaborate so far. As the instructors explain in the lectures, after teaching the class for a while, they asked some of the top software companies what one thing they wish graduates of computer science programs would learn before entering the workforce. The overwhelming answer was &quot;how to work with legacy code&quot;. So even though at first they had no idea how to teach this, they set out to do so in this class. And thus we have legacy homework 1 and 2 (last week and this week).</p>

<p>Instead of working on a new custom app, we are given an existing app (the Typo blog platform) that has a long history, sometimes messy code, and spotty test coverage. Last week we were asked to fix a bug in it. This week, we had to add a new feature!</p>

<p>Our feature in a nutshell: add the ability to merge two articles into one. The body of the new article will be a concatenation of the two previous articles. The title and author will be from one of the two articles. And the comments of all previous articles (if any) will now be comments of this article. Only administrators can merge articles. All other users will not see the option at all.</p>

<p><a href="/images/typo_merge_feature.png"><img src="/images/typo_merge_feature-sm.png" alt="picture of what the typo merge feature should look like" /></a></p>

<p>I spent a LONG time on this homework. Around 15 hours. The hardest part was writing the tests. That shouldn&#39;t be a surprise because writing the test is always the hardest part for me! I am still very new to Rspec and TestUnit syntax, and spend so long trying to figure out exactly how to phrase things. But I&#39;m proud to say that I stuck to it this time and wrote all the tests before writing the actual code (except for the view and some skeleton methods so it didn&#39;t throw method-not-found errors--basically I had to get it to the point where the tests failed for the <em>right</em> reasons and not because it couldn&#39;t find some method).</p>

<p>First I wrote the Cucumber integration tests for the happy path only. Then I wrote the unit test for the controller. It was at this time that I realized I was planning to put way too much logic in the controller. So instead of putting all the tests there, I just wrote a few to make sure the controller was asking the model for that information. Then I had to write a bunch of unit tests for the model. At last I allowed myself to write some actual code, which didn&#39;t take long.</p>

<p>Then at the very end I wrote the cucumber integration tests for the sad paths. The one thing that was SUPER helpful was using the debugger gem and plain old rails console (with the --sandbox option) while writing the tests, because it helped me figure out exactly how to get to certain elements in order to test them.</p>

<p>Even though I could have knocked out the homework in probably less than half the time without testing, I really liked the practice. It was hard but satisfying. There isn&#39;t a more satisfying and empowering feeling than when you can get all your tests passing AND you haven&#39;t even looked at your app in the browser yet with your own eyeballs... but you know it&#39;s working! This is so different than the way I used to program.</p>

<p>I also feel like testing frees up my brain from worrying about every little bit of my application. If what I&#39;m doing now will break something else, then I&#39;ll know about it soon enough (if I wrote my tests right). So all I have to do now is concentrate on writing whatever little bit I&#39;m working on now, instead of trying to keep the entire app in my head and worry about not breaking anything else.</p>

<p>A few SPECIFIC things I learned:
<ul>
    <li>in the controller, the redirect<em>to method does not redirect immediately. The rest of your method will continue running unless you specifically say &quot;return&quot; after redirecting</li>
    <li>if you want to redirect inside of a helper method (instead of a main controller action), then set that helper method as a before</em>filter of your main action method or else it won&#39;t redirect (return will just return to your main action method which will continue running)</li>
    <li>when using Capybara to find the xpath of an input element with a certain id=“name”, use &#39;input[@id=“name”]&#39; rather than &#39;input#name&#39;</li>
    <li>use <code>text_field_tag</code> to create a simple input element with a normal name like <code>merge_with</code>.. I was trying to use the <code>text_field</code> helper method and it kept making names like &quot;merge[with]&quot;. This is because text_field is &quot;tailored for accessing a specified attribute (identified by method) on an object assigned to the template&quot; -- so it&#39;s really good if you want to create input fields that correspond to your model, but if not, then it may be too complicated for your needs</li>
    <li>use &quot;tables&quot; to set up a bunch of values in Cucumber. I&#39;ve used them in previous apps but they always seemed like a mystery to me. But this time I played around with them in the debugger gem. You can <a href="https://thomassundberg.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/cucumber-data-tables/">find out more here</a>.</li>
    <li>I tried really hard to keep my git commits small, task based, and meaningful this time, which meant I had to do a few git things I&#39;ve never done before like adding specific lines instead of entire files. I really like the idea of my git history telling the story of my code. And also having the ability to revert any single change without messing anything else up.</li>
    <li>There&#39;s probably a lot of other things but these are the easy ones that I can remember off the top of my head</li>
</ul>
And if you&#39;re curious about the code I wrote for this week&#39;s homework, it&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/typo">up on Github</a>.</p>

          Overwhelmed!
        </a>

      <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2015</span>

      <p>I didn&#39;t finish my app this week! I tried to do too much. But here&#39;s what I did finish:</p>

<h3>My SaaS homework</h3>

<p>I talked a little about this last week. We had to refactor and fix some bugs in a legacy codebase (Typo). I figured out that I had to run bundle exec rake db:test:prepare if I want to run Rspec after I run Cucumber. For some reason Cucumber messes up the database. Then, the biggest road block was writing tests and then getting them to pass. I ended up overly fixing it... and the autograder was not giving me credit because it was expecting this form to be submitted to an edit action when in fact it&#39;s really a new action, so I had changed it to new in order to be more accurate.</p>

<h3>My portfolio</h3>

<p>I got it into my head that I can bang out <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/portfolio">a portfolio webpage</a> real quick. But quickly got stuck in a rut. Had a hard time setting up gulp. And it&#39;s still working weirdly. When I run &quot;gulp sass&quot; it might more might not give me an error. Then if I change some tab inside the gulpfile... or if I just run &quot;gulp&quot; without any task specified, then run &quot;gulp sass&quot; again, it may or may not just work. It&#39;s so erratic that I was tearing my hair out trying to figure it out. But I finally just gave up and wrote a shell script that does the same thing. Maybe I&#39;ll try grunt next time.</p>

<h3>My app</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/om-nom-nom">Started but didn&#39;t finish it</a>. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">But the original idea for it was pretty good. It&#39;s basically going to be a social network for yoga lovers. Yoga lovers can add yoga poses. And then they can create yoga routines by putting poses together in a certain order. Yoga poses that are shared publicly can be added on other people&#39;s routines. There will be many other features, but that&#39;s the core functionality. For example, when a routine is done, you can play it back and it will guide you through the routine in real time.</span></p>

<p>I was basing yoga poses/routines off of Youtube&#39;s videos / playlists. So I might work on it in the future. I feel like I need to at least learn a front end javascript framework before attacking this because there are pages that would be really awkward without loading things dynamically on the page without reloading the page.</p>

<h3>Level UP Rails</h3>

<p>made some progress on this curriculum. Although I started over-engineering one of the exercises, so my time was all sucked up in that. You can see it here. It&#39;s still not finished (there are some improvements I am planning) but it&#39;s basically a program that reads in two comma separated value files (CSV) of dinosaur data and creates an object that you can query. For example, you can say dinosaur.big to get a list of all the big ones. or dinosaur.bipeds. The cool thing is that you can also chain them together in any order like dinosaur.big.bipeds to get an intersection. You can see <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/level-up-exercises/tree/master/dino_catalog">my code here</a> (comments and suggestions welcome)</p>

<h3>My work</h3>

<p>I&#39;m still doing some freelance work for the library. Did a lot of refactoring of code this past week and that was oddly satisfying.</p>

<h3>Meetups</h3>

<p>went to a Ruby meetup where everyone just socialized and worked on their projects at a coffeeshop. It&#39;s not the main meetup they do (with an official speaker) but the other one where it&#39;s more just like casual hanging out.</p>

          Not Just Words
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">20 Jan 2015</span>

      <p>I had a whoops! moment the other day. A friend and I were working on a Python program together, and at one point she was asking me how I would do something. And without thinking, I said &quot;Well, we could just pass this variable in,&quot; or &quot;Just put this inside of the loop&quot;. And after a while, she said &quot;Stop saying JUST! You make it sound like it&#39;s supposed to be easy.&quot;</p>

<p>Thank god she said that, because I didn&#39;t even notice what I was doing. I immediately apologized and stopped using that word.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s amazing how (just) one word can be so alienating, and it&#39;s important to be conscious of what we say when we&#39;re learning with others. The thing is, I&#39;ve often been on the other side of that equation--where I felt stupid because I was talking to someone much more experienced, and they were using words that made it seem so easy. And I hated it!</p>

<p>Another thing: when you feel alienated by a word or how someone is saying something, tell them! Because a lot of times they may not be aware of it, and they may have the best of intentions but just not realize what they are doing.</p>

<p>So on that note, what words do you find alienating?</p>

          Week 4: Oracle of Bacon and other stuff
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2015</span>

      <p>This week, I started my <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-part-2-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-2x">SaaS Part 2</a> class... I decided to just do the SaaS homework in place of my weekly app. The homework involves the <a href="http://oracleofbacon.org/">Oracle of Bacon</a> website, where you can find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Bacon Number</a> of any actor. It also shows you the linkages along the way... for instance:
<blockquote>Sean Connery
was in Der Name der Rose with
Ron Perlman
who was in Balto with
Kevin Bacon.</blockquote>
So Sean Connery has a Bacon Number of 2. The website also has an API. You can ask it for a connection between any two actors, and it will return that information (if any) in XML format.</p>

<p>Our job was to connect to the API and write a wrapper around the XML that gets returned. Our wrapper would basically detect if the returned value was valid, and if so, it would make it into an object that we can query. The SaaS class (both part 1 and part 2) has been really good at stressing agile practices, and this homework was no different. We were to pair program over Google Hangouts on Air. The tests were written for us in this assignment, but we needed to get them to pass.</p>

<p><strong>Firsts:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>writing an abstraction layer / wrapper</li>
    <li>handling XML with <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri">nokogiri</a></li>
    <li>writing my own validation method (our class included ActiveModel&#39;s Validation methods, so it got a lot of behavior for free)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Homework 2</strong></p>

<p>I finished early so I started on homework 2, which is all about refactoring and working with legacy code. We have to clone an existing repo, the <a href="https://github.com/saasbook/typo">Typo blogging platform</a> and fix a bug in it, but first we have to write tests around the bug. Here&#39;s a Google Hangout video of me trying to work out the first part:</p>

<p>I was really confused about half an hour in because I had made some changes and my tests passed, and I was really happy with it. But then all of a sudden all the tests failed even though I hadn&#39;t changed anything since the last time! I finally figured out that I had to run bundle exec rake db:test:prepare. Although I still don&#39;t understand why... I hadn&#39;t changed the database at all since the last time I ran the tests. I thought I only had to run that command when I changed the database.</p>

<p><strong>Other things:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://leveluprails.com/">Level UP Rails</a> is a project designed to give a common baseline to engineers on the <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/rails-has-two-default-stacks">Rails Prime</a> stack. It was designed by Joseph Mastey to help onboard new hires to the Enova team. But guess what? It&#39;s also open source, so I&#39;m taking it even though Enova hasn&#39;t offered me a job yet (what are they waiting for? Fools!). So far I&#39;ve finished the first lesson of the first course, which mostly focuses on server commands and borderline sysadmin skills, many of which have intimidated me in the past. I just started on the second section entitled &#39;Basic Ruby&#39;. The overall course description is: &quot;Learn to build and test a complete Ruby on Rails application. This isn&#39;t a basic intro: you will finish with some serious ruby chops.&quot; I can&#39;t wait to have serious chops! I&#39;m documenting my progress on <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/level-up-rails">github</a>.</p>

<p>Also this week I participated in two <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/code-club">Code Club</a> sessions (through the <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/">CodeNewbie</a> website). They were great! It&#39;s sort of like hanging out with cool people while learning a lot. Each session has a host, but the host doesn&#39;t necessarily have to know any more about the subject than anyone else. It&#39;s basically like a study session; everyone is there to learn and encourage others to learn. The first one I took was on <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-variable-scope-and-hoisting-explained/">Javascript Variable Scope</a> where I got to hang out with <a href="http://bloggytoons.com/">Saron</a> and <a href="http://cynthialanel.com/">Cynthia</a>. The second one I took was <a href="http://thetechcofounder.com/getting-started-with-ember-js-using-ember-cli/">an introduction to Ember.js</a> with <a href="http://jonathanyeong.com/">Jonathan</a> and Yaw.</p>

<p>And ... and ... and ... I went to a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/atlantaruby/">Ruby Meetup</a> on Wednesday (the featured talk was on Angular JS). I met a lot of nice people. And then I got home just in time to participate in <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/chat">#CodeNewbie Twitter Chat</a>! I didn&#39;t feel like I did that much this week, but I guess I did!</p>

          Learning Roadmap
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2015</span>

      <p>One of the hardest things about self-guided learning is coming up with a disciplined curriculum of some sort. School is good for giving you some kind of structure in which to learn, but when you&#39;re learning on your own, you can go in any direction, which can be good and bad. When you don&#39;t know a lot, you may not even know what is worth learning and what isn&#39;t. It&#39;s really easy to end up learning &quot;spastically&quot; -- by which I mean, I&#39;ll learn a little bit of this until I see something shiny over here and then I&#39;ll learn that before I finish learning this, etc. Meanwhile maybe there&#39;s something else that is super important to what your end-goal is, but since you didn&#39;t read the right blog posts, you never even find out about it... the proverbial &quot;things you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>So it&#39;s important to start with a rough roadmap, and re-assess that roadmap regularly to see what spots you&#39;re missing. Here is my current roadmap:
<ul>
    <li>take the EdX.org <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-part-2-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-2x">Software as a Service Part 2</a> class. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x">Part 1</a> was super helpful in terms of learning basic Ruby/Rails, testing and agile practices. Part 2 focuses on more advanced Rails topics as well as working with legacy code. I am currently in week 2 of this class, which ends in mid-February.</li>
    <li>continue writing an app per week, with the following caveats:
<ul>
    <li>I want to learn at least one new thing per app. currently it&#39;s pretty hard <em>not</em> to learn one new thing, as I know relatively little. But as I learn more, I will probably want more specific goals like &quot;learn to make an API for my app&quot; or &quot;learn to write a simple gem&quot;.</li>
    <li>Since I am also taking the EdX SaaS class, on weeks where my SaaS homework is pretty involved, I can substitute that homework assignment for my weekly app</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://leveluprails.com/">Level UP Rails</a> -- I heard about this curriculum through the Ruby Rogues podcast episode <a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/190-rr-apprenticeship-with-joseph-mastey-and-jill-lynch-of-enova">&quot;Apprenticeship with Joseph Mastey and Jill Lynch of Enova&quot;</a> where Joseph talks about implementing an apprenticeship program at his company for onboarding new hires who show a lot of potential but who may not be as technically proficient. These apprentices spend the first few months just learning the company&#39;s stack, codebase, and a lot of other basic skills. Joseph also mentioned that the curriculum that he designed is now open source! It&#39;s available at <a href="https://leveluprails.com/">https://leveluprails.com/</a>. So far I&#39;m really enjoying this curriculum. It provides just enough guidance and links about each topic so that you know what you should learn, without providing too much more. Then it&#39;s your responsibility to Google it if you want to know more. There are also exercises at the end of each section. I also find the way the exercise titles are phrased to be amusing... I&#39;m not sure if this was a conscious decision but they&#39;re phrased to sound like unit test describe blocks..., for example &quot;Knows what ports are and can use netstat to find them&quot;. You can follow <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/level-up-rails">my progress on github</a>, where I&#39;ll record my answers to the exercises as well as whatever personal notes I want to remember for later.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.poodr.com/">Read Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby</a> by Sandi Metz - this is a great book so far. If you haven&#39;t already, go watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sandi+metz">Sandi Metz&#39;s talks</a> on YouTube. I&#39;ve learned so much from her.</li>
    <li>Continue to blog at least once a week.</li>
</ul>
Those are my top priorities. And here are some of my lesser goals that would be wonderful to accomplish if I can find the time:
<ul>
    <li>read <a href="http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/JavaScript_Enlightenment.pdf">JS Enlightenment</a></li>
    <li>read <a href="https://www.justinweiss.com/book/">Practicing Rails</a></li>
    <li>learn a JavaScript framework (Ember? Backbone? Angular? Meteor?)</li>
</ul>
Social or career oriented goals:
<ul>
    <li>Continue to attend meetups / hackathons</li>
    <li>Create my resume webpage</li>
    <li>Make some business cards</li>
</ul>
Non programming related:
<ul>
    <li>ride the <a href="http://streetcar.atlantaga.gov/">Atlanta Streetcar</a> which just opened up about a month ago.</li>
    <li>go to the <a href="http://www.thekingcenter.org/">Martin Luther King Center</a> I&#39;ve lived within 2 miles from the MLK center, drive by it all the time, and yet I&#39;ve never visited. There&#39;s no excuse for that!</li>
</ul></p>
