          Not Just Words

      <span class="post-date">20 Jan 2015</span>

      <p>I had a whoops! moment the other day. A friend and I were working on a Python program together, and at one point she was asking me how I would do something. And without thinking, I said &quot;Well, we could just pass this variable in,&quot; or &quot;Just put this inside of the loop&quot;. And after a while, she said &quot;Stop saying JUST! You make it sound like it&#39;s supposed to be easy.&quot;</p>

<p>Thank god she said that, because I didn&#39;t even notice what I was doing. I immediately apologized and stopped using that word.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s amazing how (just) one word can be so alienating, and it&#39;s important to be conscious of what we say when we&#39;re learning with others. The thing is, I&#39;ve often been on the other side of that equation--where I felt stupid because I was talking to someone much more experienced, and they were using words that made it seem so easy. And I hated it!</p>

<p>Another thing: when you feel alienated by a word or how someone is saying something, tell them! Because a lot of times they may not be aware of it, and they may have the best of intentions but just not realize what they are doing.</p>

<p>So on that note, what words do you find alienating?</p>

          Week 4: Oracle of Bacon and other stuff
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2015</span>

      <p>This week, I started my <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-part-2-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-2x">SaaS Part 2</a> class... I decided to just do the SaaS homework in place of my weekly app. The homework involves the <a href="http://oracleofbacon.org/">Oracle of Bacon</a> website, where you can find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Bacon Number</a> of any actor. It also shows you the linkages along the way... for instance:
<blockquote>Sean Connery
was in Der Name der Rose with
Ron Perlman
who was in Balto with
Kevin Bacon.</blockquote>
So Sean Connery has a Bacon Number of 2. The website also has an API. You can ask it for a connection between any two actors, and it will return that information (if any) in XML format.</p>

<p>Our job was to connect to the API and write a wrapper around the XML that gets returned. Our wrapper would basically detect if the returned value was valid, and if so, it would make it into an object that we can query. The SaaS class (both part 1 and part 2) has been really good at stressing agile practices, and this homework was no different. We were to pair program over Google Hangouts on Air. The tests were written for us in this assignment, but we needed to get them to pass.</p>

<p><strong>Firsts:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>writing an abstraction layer / wrapper</li>
    <li>handling XML with <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri">nokogiri</a></li>
    <li>writing my own validation method (our class included ActiveModel&#39;s Validation methods, so it got a lot of behavior for free)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Homework 2</strong></p>

<p>I finished early so I started on homework 2, which is all about refactoring and working with legacy code. We have to clone an existing repo, the <a href="https://github.com/saasbook/typo">Typo blogging platform</a> and fix a bug in it, but first we have to write tests around the bug. Here&#39;s a Google Hangout video of me trying to work out the first part:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tvMJCXvf7ds" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I was really confused about half an hour in because I had made some changes and my tests passed, and I was really happy with it. But then all of a sudden all the tests failed even though I hadn&#39;t changed anything since the last time! I finally figured out that I had to run bundle exec rake db:test:prepare. Although I still don&#39;t understand why... I hadn&#39;t changed the database at all since the last time I ran the tests. I thought I only had to run that command when I changed the database.</p>

<p><strong>Other things:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://leveluprails.com/">Level UP Rails</a> is a project designed to give a common baseline to engineers on the <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/rails-has-two-default-stacks">Rails Prime</a> stack. It was designed by Joseph Mastey to help onboard new hires to the Enova team. But guess what? It&#39;s also open source, so I&#39;m taking it even though Enova hasn&#39;t offered me a job yet (what are they waiting for? Fools!). So far I&#39;ve finished the first lesson of the first course, which mostly focuses on server commands and borderline sysadmin skills, many of which have intimidated me in the past. I just started on the second section entitled &#39;Basic Ruby&#39;. The overall course description is: &quot;Learn to build and test a complete Ruby on Rails application. This isn&#39;t a basic intro: you will finish with some serious ruby chops.&quot; I can&#39;t wait to have serious chops! I&#39;m documenting my progress on <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/level-up-rails">github</a>.</p>

<p>Also this week I participated in two <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/code-club">Code Club</a> sessions (through the <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/">CodeNewbie</a> website). They were great! It&#39;s sort of like hanging out with cool people while learning a lot. Each session has a host, but the host doesn&#39;t necessarily have to know any more about the subject than anyone else. It&#39;s basically like a study session; everyone is there to learn and encourage others to learn. The first one I took was on <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-variable-scope-and-hoisting-explained/">Javascript Variable Scope</a> where I got to hang out with <a href="http://bloggytoons.com/">Saron</a> and <a href="http://cynthialanel.com/">Cynthia</a>. The second one I took was <a href="http://thetechcofounder.com/getting-started-with-ember-js-using-ember-cli/">an introduction to Ember.js</a> with <a href="http://jonathanyeong.com/">Jonathan</a> and Yaw.</p>

<p>And ... and ... and ... I went to a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/atlantaruby/">Ruby Meetup</a> on Wednesday (the featured talk was on Angular JS). I met a lot of nice people. And then I got home just in time to participate in <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/chat">#CodeNewbie Twitter Chat</a>! I didn&#39;t feel like I did that much this week, but I guess I did!</p>

          Learning Roadmap
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2015</span>

      <p>One of the hardest things about self-guided learning is coming up with a disciplined curriculum of some sort. School is good for giving you some kind of structure in which to learn, but when you&#39;re learning on your own, you can go in any direction, which can be good and bad. When you don&#39;t know a lot, you may not even know what is worth learning and what isn&#39;t. It&#39;s really easy to end up learning &quot;spastically&quot; -- by which I mean, I&#39;ll learn a little bit of this until I see something shiny over here and then I&#39;ll learn that before I finish learning this, etc. Meanwhile maybe there&#39;s something else that is super important to what your end-goal is, but since you didn&#39;t read the right blog posts, you never even find out about it... the proverbial &quot;things you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>So it&#39;s important to start with a rough roadmap, and re-assess that roadmap regularly to see what spots you&#39;re missing. Here is my current roadmap:
<ul>
    <li>take the EdX.org <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-part-2-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-2x">Software as a Service Part 2</a> class. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x">Part 1</a> was super helpful in terms of learning basic Ruby/Rails, testing and agile practices. Part 2 focuses on more advanced Rails topics as well as working with legacy code. I am currently in week 2 of this class, which ends in mid-February.</li>
    <li>continue writing an app per week, with the following caveats:
<ul>
    <li>I want to learn at least one new thing per app. currently it&#39;s pretty hard <em>not</em> to learn one new thing, as I know relatively little. But as I learn more, I will probably want more specific goals like &quot;learn to make an API for my app&quot; or &quot;learn to write a simple gem&quot;.</li>
    <li>Since I am also taking the EdX SaaS class, on weeks where my SaaS homework is pretty involved, I can substitute that homework assignment for my weekly app</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://leveluprails.com/">Level UP Rails</a> -- I heard about this curriculum through the Ruby Rogues podcast episode <a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/190-rr-apprenticeship-with-joseph-mastey-and-jill-lynch-of-enova">&quot;Apprenticeship with Joseph Mastey and Jill Lynch of Enova&quot;</a> where Joseph talks about implementing an apprenticeship program at his company for onboarding new hires who show a lot of potential but who may not be as technically proficient. These apprentices spend the first few months just learning the company&#39;s stack, codebase, and a lot of other basic skills. Joseph also mentioned that the curriculum that he designed is now open source! It&#39;s available at <a href="https://leveluprails.com/">https://leveluprails.com/</a>. So far I&#39;m really enjoying this curriculum. It provides just enough guidance and links about each topic so that you know what you should learn, without providing too much more. Then it&#39;s your responsibility to Google it if you want to know more. There are also exercises at the end of each section. I also find the way the exercise titles are phrased to be amusing... I&#39;m not sure if this was a conscious decision but they&#39;re phrased to sound like unit test describe blocks..., for example &quot;Knows what ports are and can use netstat to find them&quot;. You can follow <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/level-up-rails">my progress on github</a>, where I&#39;ll record my answers to the exercises as well as whatever personal notes I want to remember for later.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.poodr.com/">Read Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby</a> by Sandi Metz - this is a great book so far. If you haven&#39;t already, go watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sandi+metz">Sandi Metz&#39;s talks</a> on YouTube. I&#39;ve learned so much from her.</li>
    <li>Continue to blog at least once a week.</li>
</ul>
Those are my top priorities. And here are some of my lesser goals that would be wonderful to accomplish if I can find the time:

    <li>read <a href="http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/JavaScript_Enlightenment.pdf">JS Enlightenment</a></li>
    <li>read <a href="https://www.justinweiss.com/book/">Practicing Rails</a></li>
    <li>learn a JavaScript framework (Ember? Backbone? Angular? Meteor?)</li>
</ul>
Social or career oriented goals:
<ul>
    <li>Continue to attend meetups / hackathons</li>
    <li>Create my resume webpage</li>
    <li>Make some business cards</li>
</ul>
Non programming related:
<ul>
    <li>ride the <a href="http://streetcar.atlantaga.gov/">Atlanta Streetcar</a> which just opened up about a month ago.</li>
    <li>go to the <a href="http://www.thekingcenter.org/">Martin Luther King Center</a> I&#39;ve lived within 2 miles from the MLK center, drive by it all the time, and yet I&#39;ve never visited. There&#39;s no excuse for that!</li>
</ul></p>

          My Coding 'Journey'
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">14 Jan 2015</span>

      <p>I&#39;ve been hanging out at the <a href="http://codenewbie.org">Code Newbie</a> website a lot lately, talking in the forums as well as listening to the excellent <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast">podcasts</a> hosted by <a href="http://bloggytoons.com/">Saron Yitbarek</a>. She interviews programmers not only about the technical nitty gritty, but also about the more human side of software development. One of these topics is: how do people get started in software development? What was your first app? What was something you wish you knew before you got into programming?</p>

<p>So far in this blog I haven&#39;t divulged many personal details, and you may even be wondering &quot;who is this Jimmy Lo anyway?&quot; This may be because I feel like my story isn&#39;t nearly as dramatic or interesting as many others. I didn&#39;t change careers (at least not in the traditional sense), or go through bootcamp, or battle many personal adversities.</p>

<p>In fact, my interest in programming started with BASIC in high school, and I was a computer science major in college. So technically I&#39;m not a &quot;newbie&quot; at all (despite how I feel inside). In college, I wrote programs in Pascal, C, Lisp, Smalltalk, as well as making websites for fun in plain HTML and CSS (this was before CMSs existed). After graduating, I worked in a design firm doing their web development, mostly working in Flash and Actionscript as well as some ASP. Then, I made my dramatic career change--<em>away</em> from computers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always loved writing, and in 2003, I moved to Tempe, Arizona to pursue a Master of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing-Poetry at Arizona State University.</p>

<p><img src="/images/freepoems_cl-sm.jpg" alt="my Free Poems on Demand project in the Creative Loafing" width="300" height="225" align="right" />Long story short: I eventually focused a lot of my energies towards writing and the arts, which you can find out more about if you go to <a href="http://jimmylorunning.com">my main website here</a>. I still coded, but my attention had been diverted. My skills lagged. When I moved back to Atlanta, I got a job at the county library as the in-house web developer, building out their website as well as making useful tools in PHP to streamline their day to day tasks.</p>

<p>Last year, I quit in order to do freelance work and have more time to learn new things (both professionally and personally). Despite the financial hit, I think it was worth it--my interest in coding has blossomed since then. I am now learning more than I ever had.</p>

<p>Even though I don&#39;t regret spending time on other interests, I also wish I had dedicated more of it towards coding. When I think back on it, I realize that all my programming jobs have been at places where I was the only programmer, or I was only one of a very small team where everyone just worked on their own code. Even though I&#39;m not technically a newbie, I feel like one when it comes to collaborating in a team and working on a shared codebase. And as a programmer, the best way to learn is to collaborate with a team of smart people that will push you. This kind of learning and working environment is what I crave now.</p>

<p>Luckily, I&#39;m getting back into the game right when coding is starting to get a lot more mainstream and exciting. Free learning resources are all over the web, and the community is super supportive. Open source software has made code available to all. And attitudes are also improving. Programming has gotten a lot more inclusive to newbies and non-programmers alike. People who don&#39;t come from a traditional computer science background can easily enter the field. All of this is encouraging and makes me feel like I am moving in the right direction.</p>

          Week 3 Round Up: Twitter Fitter&#8212;the tweet generator!
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2015</span>

      <p>So there&#39;s still a lot more work I want to do on my week 3 app <a href="https://secret-brushlands-4139.herokuapp.com/">Twitter Fitter</a>. But the general idea is there--it&#39;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov generator</a>. You type in a twitter handle, and it spits back a generated tweet (or tweet-like string) that is in the style of that user. (Try @DATABASE_HULK, @StephenAtHome, @BarackObama, or @kimkardashian) Part of the app/week project is that I want to learn something new each time. So what did I learn this week?</p>

<h3>Firsts:</h3>

<p>Well, this was my first app where I had to connect to another service (in this case it was the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter API</a> through the <a href="https://github.com/sferik/twitter">Twitter gem</a>) and also the first app where I wrote my own POROs (plain old Ruby objects) inside of Rails. In fact, this was barely a Rails app. It doesn&#39;t even have a model. It&#39;s mostly just a single page that connects to Twitter and then runs the MarkovChain object that I wrote for it. I also obviously learned a lot about Markov generators and how they work. (I knew about them generally but never thought about how to write one before)</p>

<h3>Testing:</h3>

<p>I was able to write <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/twitter-fitter/blob/master/spec/lib/markov_chain_spec.rb">tests for my MarkovChain object</a>. I&#39;m pretty proud of this. But I haven&#39;t written tests for the actual controller code yet (which is currently very messy).</p>

<h3>To do:</h3>

<p>As always there are still many things I want to do to improve it:
<ul>
    <li>Needs major styling. Looks really ugly right now. I want it to look good!</li>
    <li>I want you to be able to retweet the generated tweets. Maybe it will retweet it from a custom account, maybe @TwitterFitter</li>
    <li>I want to make a gem out of the MarkovChain object. There are already similar gems out there (and my algorithm isn&#39;t all that unique), but I think it would be a learning experience to create my own gem.</li>
    <li>Tweak my generator code. Currently it&#39;s pretty simple, and the results are either pretty funny / nonsensical or else they&#39;re pretty boring (like almost word for word of an existing tweet rather than a mix-match of different tweets)</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Challenges:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>writing the <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/twitter-fitter/blob/master/lib/markov_chain.rb">actual Markov generator</a>, and making it perform okay as well as be open to modification in the future if I wanted to change the way it works later. For example, I thought it would be cool if I could pass it a lambda so that it picks the next word based on running that lambda code. The default is just random, but maybe someone would want to tweak it themselves without having to go into my code.</li>
    <li>figuring out how to call private / public methods within my class, and whether or not to even use private methods. <a title="self or no self" href="http://jimmylocoding.com/2015/01/09/self-or-no-self/">Here's a blog post I wrote</a> about this topic.</li>
    <li>tweaking the generator. When I use a prefix length of 2, I get back text that's very similar to the original text, so much so that it's kind of boring. If I set it to 1, I get back things that are sometimes very nonsensical. I decided on 1. But it would be nice to come up with a different algorithm so that it's between totally nonsensical and completely boring.</li>
    <li>figuring out how to include my ruby object in the lib directory and have rails auto include it. I was not naming my file correctly, so it didn't include it when autoloading! Took me some extra googling to figure out why.</li>
    <li>writing test code. I'm not sure I did it right, but testing code that's supposed to be random was also kind of tricky. I had to <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Random.html#method-c-srand">seed the generator</a> with values so that it would be predictable/testable.</li>
    <li>using the Twitter gem. I had to figure out how to give it my API keys and secrets without exposing it through github. I wrote a <a title="Hiding my API keys" href="http://jimmylocoding.com/2015/01/07/hiding-my-api-keys/">blog post about this here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next week(s):</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve mentioned taking the incredibly helpful <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x">edX.org SaaS class</a> (Software as a Service) before. Well, <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-part-2-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-2x">part 2 of the class</a> has just started, so instead of continuing with my own apps, I will be doing the SaaS homework apps every week for the next few weeks. It&#39;s only a few weeks, and there&#39;s not a homework for <em>every</em> week, so it won&#39;t be taking over this project completely, but its presence will definitely be felt. I will still be blogging about my discoveries, though! Hope you&#39;ll keep reading.</p>
