          Method Chaining to the Madness
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2015</span>

      <p>I said I&#39;d write a little bit about some of the challenges I encountered while writing the <a href="https://github.com/codeforatlanta/csv_geocoder">CSV Geocoder</a> utility. So here&#39;s a small problem and solution:</p>

<h3>Problem:</h3>

<p>The purpose of the class is very simple. I want to add geocode data to the CSV, then write it to a file. So I write a method like <code>write_csv_with_geocode(file)</code> that joins the CSV with the geocode data and then writes it to a file. However, this violates the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">single responsibility</a> per method principle. It does two things: adds the geocode data, then writes it to a file.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">write_csv_with_geocode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">merge_csv_with</span> <span class="n">lat_lngs</span>
  <span class="no">CSV</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;wb&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">csv</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="vi">@csv</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">row</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">csv</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">row</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I could break the method out into two separate methods, but I know that in 99% of the use cases, the user will want to add_geocode then write. The two responsibilities are intimately related in this case. So the user would have to type two methods (three if you count the initializer) instead of one every time, like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">CSVGeocoder</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="s1">&#39;data.csv&#39;</span>
<span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_geocode</span>
<span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span> <span class="s1">&#39;data_with_geocode.csv&#39;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>which wouldn&#39;t be so bad if it weren&#39;t something they&#39;d have to do every time for such a simple task.</p>

<p>The upside of having it all in one method is that I can accomplish two related tasks in one method call instead of having to call both of them separately every time.</p>

<h3>Solution:</h3>

<p>Chaining! I make add_geocode assign the new value to an instance variable, then return self (returning self is the key to making methods chainable). Then the write method takes the instance variable and writes it to a CSV file. So now the user can do the simple task in one line, and the operations are also separated into their own methods. Best of both worlds! In fact, I realized I could do the same with all of the methods in the class, so that you could now write the following line:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">CSVGeocoder</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;data.csv&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_geocode</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span> <span class="s1">&#39;data_with_geocode.csv&#39;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Isn&#39;t it pretty? Here&#39;s the new code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_geocode</span>
  <span class="vi">@new_csv</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">merge_csv_with</span> <span class="n">lat_lngs</span>
  <span class="nb">self</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="no">CSV</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;wb&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">csv</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="vi">@new_csv</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">row</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">csv</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">row</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<h3>What do you think?</h3>

<p>Is chaining a good solution to this problem? How would you have done it? Also: are there other ways I could improve this class?</p>

          CodeAcross Atlanta: Revitalizing South Downtown
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2015</span>

      <p>This past weekend, I attended my first hackathon-like event (there was no competitive element, so it&#39;s not a hackathon, technically speaking). Organized by <a href="http://www.codeforatlanta.org/">Code For Atlanta</a> and hosted by the <a href="http://www.civicatlanta.org/">Center for Civic Innovation</a> as part of an international <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2015/">CodeAcross event</a>, we met in South Downtown Atlanta to tackle the problems there, namely, how to revitalize the neighborhood.</p>

<p>In order to tackle the problem, we first had to understand the problem. So after a quick presentation on the history of the area, we took a walking tour of it. This introduction was captivating, but at the same time, I didn&#39;t see eye to eye with our hosts.</p>

<p>Many of the participants of this event were not from this area. They see it as a dilapidated poor neighborhood that needs to be cleaned up. But I live within 5 miles of South Downtown and enjoy biking through the area. I also regularly attend shows at the <a href="http://www.eyedrum.org/">Eyedrum Art Gallery</a> and <a href="http://www.mammalgallery.com/">Mammal Gallery</a>. Yes, the neighborhood is poor, but people live and work here too. Often when we say we want to revitalize a neighborhood, it means gentrification. When we say we want to attract new developers, we&#39;re also implying that we want the old businesses out. That means <a href="http://largefeet.com/">Friedman&#39;s Shoes</a>, who&#39;s been serving large feet since 1929. That means the local charm of <a href="http://clatl.com/atlanta/i-like-south-downtown-atlanta-the-way-it-is/Content?oid=4209416">Rondo</a>, which sells hexes, charms, and mojo powder.</p>

<p>But I wasn&#39;t completely against the enterprise. I agree that many things could be improved in this area. But I tried to steer our group into thinking about what those needs were based on what the locals wanted instead of what tourists would want. To improve the area, we must improve the lives of the people in the area, not bring new people in.</p>

<p><img src="/images/southdowntown1.jpg" alt="South Downtown Atlanta" /></p>

<p>Perhaps this is all too political for a tech blog, so let me go back to describing the rest of the weekend&#39;s events.</p>

<p>We broke into three groups:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Branding and storytelling</strong> - how to brand the neighborhood to attract the &#39;right&#39; elements</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive asset map</strong> - so people can see what&#39;s there and what can be there</li>
    <li><strong>Participatory tool</strong> - to gather opinions from the community about what the area needs</li>
</ol>
I joined the second group because I was interested in mapping and because I felt like I could learn the most there. First we talked about who the audience for the map could be, and given that, what assets we could or should map. Then we broke into two groups, one responsible for data gathering and one for building out the map with the given data. I joined the latter group, which consisted of four people: me, <a href="http://mollietaylor.com/">Mollie</a>, <a href="http://luigimontanez.com/">Luigi</a>, and <a href="http://www.bryan-lackey.com/">Bryan</a>.</p>

<p>Mollie was the resident expert on maps and mapping. She showed us how to use <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a> to quickly build out maps and create interactive event based behaviors. While she built out a prototype, the rest of us went through some tutorials to get acquainted with Leaflet, and also explore other possibilities like <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>.</p>

<p>After that, I started to think about where I could be most useful. Since Mollie was already kicking ass on the maps, I thought I could do something to help import the data. The data gathering team was sending us Excel files with street addresses. In order to plot the points, geocode data was needed, which just means latitude and longitude. So I decided to write a small utility that would take a CSV file and write a new CSV file with all the existing data plus latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>Writing a script to do that wouldn&#39;t have taken long, but I thought this might be a tool that could be used in the future by Code For Atlanta or other similar groups faced with this same problem. So I worked on a Ruby program that could potentially be re-used in other projects. You can see the code for it <a href="https://github.com/codeforatlanta/csv_geocoder">on GitHub</a>, and I&#39;ll probably write a follow up post soon on a few interesting design challenges I ran into.</p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>

<p>Things began slowly with coffee at 9am. A few folks stared into their laptops like zombies. I was one of those. My CSV Geocoder was working, but I couldn&#39;t help tinkering with it, refactoring and improving it (in fact, I was still doing that earlier today). But more of the data was coming in in different formats. I was looking for a new task to do.</p>

<p>One of the things Mollie implemented the day before was integration of <a href="https://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> data from their API. We were now pulling in data about government buildings in South Downtown. But what other Foursquare locations could we map? I wrote some scripts to automate this query. Other than that, I did some research on icons, and I also talked with members of the other teams about what they were doing.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we all presented our projects. It was inspiring to see how much progress we made in just two days, and also to think about how all three projects will integrate into one larger project. The map will live on the website that the branding group created (which will eventually live at <a href="http://www.southdowntown.org/">southdowntown.org</a>) and the participatory tool created by the third team will eventually feed back into the map and website so that the wishes and desires of the locals will be our guide.</p>

<p>Speaking of the future, this weekend was just the beginning of a longer effort. We will continue to meet about once a month to continue developing this project.</p>

<p>Overall, I had a great first hackathon. I met some amazing people and learned a lot from them. I worked on interesting projects, and I got to become more familiar with a local neighborhood.</p>

<p>To learn more about the details of making the map, creating the layers and interactions, go read <a href="http://blog.mollietaylor.com/codeacross-asset-map.html">Mollie&#39;s excellent blog post</a> about this same event! It&#39;s pretty great. You can also see the source of both the asset map and my CSV geocoder on the <a href="https://github.com/codeforatlanta/">codeforatlanta GitHub page</a>.</p>

          TwitterFitter v2.0

      <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2015</span>

      <p>So I decided to revisit my <a href="http://jimmylocoding.com/2015/01/12/week-3-round-up-twitter-fitter/">week 3 app</a>, TwitterFitter. At the end of week 3, it was a simple app that generated tweets based on a Twitter handle. The tweets it generated would be in the style of the Twitter account you gave it. It does this by chaining together words that often appear together. But there were a lot of things lacking in the app, so this week I revisited it and made it much better!</p>

<p><a href="https://secret-brushlands-4139.herokuapp.com/">Version 2.0 of Twitter Fitter</a> has a new design (it was just a white page before), and you can now enter TWO twitter handles and the app will generate tweets based on BOTH feeds combined. Also, you can now tweet the results (it tweets from the @FitterTweets account).</p>

<p>Most of these enhancements were straight forward, but there were a few tricky parts:
<ol>
    <li>At first, the generated tweets appeared on the results page and when you clicked &quot;Tweet!&quot;, it would tweet whatever was in the text field. But then I started thinking: is this a magnet for spammers? Anyone could just erase what&#39;s in that text field, type something new in, and click &quot;Tweet!&quot; and it would look like it was coming from the @FitterTweets account. This is a major security flaw, and even though there many ways to hide this information, like making the field uneditable and in a POST action instead of a GET action, people could still easily spoof it. So instead of sending the tweet from a form, I saved the generated tweets in a Tweet model as soon as they are generated. Then in the results page, in addition to showing the tweets in a text field, I also include a hidden field with the ID of the generated tweet (from the model). So when you click &quot;Tweet!&quot; you&#39;re not actually tweeting anything from the form, you&#39;re just saying &quot;tweet this previously generated tweet with this ID&quot;. So everything that is tweeted from the account is pretty much vetted and safe (at least I hope so).</li>
    <li>My controller was getting pretty fat, and I had to look at it long and hard and figure out how to refactor it. I decided to make a Feeds class, which now lives in the lib folder. It wasn&#39;t easy breaking apart the fat methods in the controller, but I&#39;m glad I did because it looks much cleaner this way.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>To Do</h3>

<p>Tests! For the Feed class and for the controller. I&#39;m not very good at writing tests before the code, but as long as I write the tests some time, that&#39;s probably better than never.</p>

<p>Please take a look at my code <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/twitter-fitter">on GitHub</a>, and play around with it <a href="https://secret-brushlands-4139.herokuapp.com/">on Heroku</a>. Any feedback is welcome!&quot;</p>

      <p>Didn&#39;t get anything (app-wise) presentable to the world out this week. However, I did finish off a bunch of loose-ends at my freelance jobs and such, so I&#39;m feeling pretty good about that. Just a quick round-up. I&#39;ll have a longer blog post about other topics soon.
<ul>
    <li>made a lot of changes to the library site code... mostly refactorings, but also fixed some bugs</li>
    <li>another freelance project is coming to the end; it feels good to be in the home stretch</li>
    <li>SaaS - no homework this week, just a pretty extensive quiz that I didn&#39;t do very good on. The topic is design patterns, and I feel like it would be better as a homework assignment so we could actually practice them rather than quiz questions, because patterns are already such abstract concepts, it&#39;s hard to answer questions about them without tying them to a real app. I had a lot of trouble with the wording and terminology of many of the questions. I feel like I understood the concepts pretty well, but the wording always gets me to pick the wrong thing. But the bigger picture, that of design patterns, was still very useful, and is one area that I&#39;ll need to get better at (both recognizing when to use them and actually implementing them well)</li>
    <li>My <a href="http://jimmylocoding.com/resume">resume</a>. I&#39;m still working on my portfolio site when I can find a spare second, but until it&#39;s done <a href="http://jimmylocoding.com/resume">this resume</a> will be my face on the job market. It was made in <a href="https://jsonresume.org/">JSON Resume</a> (an open source solution). Fellow #codenewbie Jonathan told me about it, and it&#39;s really saved me a lot of time by separating the presentation layer from the content (which is coded in JSON).</li>
    <li>Rails API + Ember - I worked on following <a href="https://devmynd.com/blog/2014-7-rails-ember-js-with-the-ember-cli-redux">this tutorial</a> which is pretty straight forward, although probably not written for Rails newbies. There were a few things it did where I felt happy that it worked without knowing why it worked. Going back over it, I feel like I understand the main concepts well, but the details would be hard to reproduce in another app without following each step over again.</li>
    <li>I started a #codenewbie <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/code-club">Code Club</a> on making pull requests. Code Club is a great one-hour study session where we tackle a problem (doing a pull request in this case) and teach each other. We went through <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/how-to-make-a-pull-request">this helpful article</a> on doing pull requests as well as putting what it said into practice on my <a href="https://still-sands-5922.herokuapp.com/index.php">Exquisite Source</a> repo <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/exquisite-source">on github</a>.</li>
