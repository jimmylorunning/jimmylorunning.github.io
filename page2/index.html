          TwitterFitter v2.0
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2015</span>

      <p>So I decided to revisit my <a href="http://jimmylocoding.com/2015/01/12/week-3-round-up-twitter-fitter/">week 3 app</a>, TwitterFitter. At the end of week 3, it was a simple app that generated tweets based on a Twitter handle. The tweets it generated would be in the style of the Twitter account you gave it. It does this by chaining together words that often appear together. But there were a lot of things lacking in the app, so this week I revisited it and made it much better!</p>

<p><a href="https://secret-brushlands-4139.herokuapp.com/">Version 2.0 of Twitter Fitter</a> has a new design (it was just a white page before), and you can now enter TWO twitter handles and the app will generate tweets based on BOTH feeds combined. Also, you can now tweet the results (it tweets from the @FitterTweets account).</p>

<p>Most of these enhancements were straight forward, but there were a few tricky parts:
<ol>
    <li>At first, the generated tweets appeared on the results page and when you clicked &quot;Tweet!&quot;, it would tweet whatever was in the text field. But then I started thinking: is this a magnet for spammers? Anyone could just erase what&#39;s in that text field, type something new in, and click &quot;Tweet!&quot; and it would look like it was coming from the @FitterTweets account. This is a major security flaw, and even though there many ways to hide this information, like making the field uneditable and in a POST action instead of a GET action, people could still easily spoof it. So instead of sending the tweet from a form, I saved the generated tweets in a Tweet model as soon as they are generated. Then in the results page, in addition to showing the tweets in a text field, I also include a hidden field with the ID of the generated tweet (from the model). So when you click &quot;Tweet!&quot; you&#39;re not actually tweeting anything from the form, you&#39;re just saying &quot;tweet this previously generated tweet with this ID&quot;. So everything that is tweeted from the account is pretty much vetted and safe (at least I hope so).</li>
    <li>My controller was getting pretty fat, and I had to look at it long and hard and figure out how to refactor it. I decided to make a Feeds class, which now lives in the lib folder. It wasn&#39;t easy breaking apart the fat methods in the controller, but I&#39;m glad I did because it looks much cleaner this way.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>To Do</h3>

<p>Tests! For the Feed class and for the controller. I&#39;m not very good at writing tests before the code, but as long as I write the tests some time, that&#39;s probably better than never.</p>

<p>Please take a look at my code <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/twitter-fitter">on GitHub</a>, and play around with it <a href="https://secret-brushlands-4139.herokuapp.com/">on Heroku</a>. Any feedback is welcome!&quot;</p>

      <p>Didn&#39;t get anything (app-wise) presentable to the world out this week. However, I did finish off a bunch of loose-ends at my freelance jobs and such, so I&#39;m feeling pretty good about that. Just a quick round-up. I&#39;ll have a longer blog post about other topics soon.
<ul>
    <li>made a lot of changes to the library site code... mostly refactorings, but also fixed some bugs</li>
    <li>another freelance project is coming to the end; it feels good to be in the home stretch</li>
    <li>SaaS - no homework this week, just a pretty extensive quiz that I didn&#39;t do very good on. The topic is design patterns, and I feel like it would be better as a homework assignment so we could actually practice them rather than quiz questions, because patterns are already such abstract concepts, it&#39;s hard to answer questions about them without tying them to a real app. I had a lot of trouble with the wording and terminology of many of the questions. I feel like I understood the concepts pretty well, but the wording always gets me to pick the wrong thing. But the bigger picture, that of design patterns, was still very useful, and is one area that I&#39;ll need to get better at (both recognizing when to use them and actually implementing them well)</li>
    <li>My <a href="http://jimmylocoding.com/resume">resume</a>. I&#39;m still working on my portfolio site when I can find a spare second, but until it&#39;s done <a href="http://jimmylocoding.com/resume">this resume</a> will be my face on the job market. It was made in <a href="https://jsonresume.org/">JSON Resume</a> (an open source solution). Fellow #codenewbie Jonathan told me about it, and it&#39;s really saved me a lot of time by separating the presentation layer from the content (which is coded in JSON).</li>
    <li>Rails API + Ember - I worked on following <a href="https://devmynd.com/blog/2014-7-rails-ember-js-with-the-ember-cli-redux">this tutorial</a> which is pretty straight forward, although probably not written for Rails newbies. There were a few things it did where I felt happy that it worked without knowing why it worked. Going back over it, I feel like I understand the main concepts well, but the details would be hard to reproduce in another app without following each step over again.</li>
    <li>I started a #codenewbie <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/code-club">Code Club</a> on making pull requests. Code Club is a great one-hour study session where we tackle a problem (doing a pull request in this case) and teach each other. We went through <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/how-to-make-a-pull-request">this helpful article</a> on doing pull requests as well as putting what it said into practice on my <a href="https://still-sands-5922.herokuapp.com/index.php">Exquisite Source</a> repo <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/exquisite-source">on github</a>.</li>

      <p><a href="/lilt/"><img src="/images/lilt.png" alt="Lilt" width="789" height="469" /></a></p>

<p>I was working on my portfolio site last week and playing with the parallax effect when I had the idea of making a CSS shadow that moved as you scrolled to create the illusion of depth and a single source of light (imagine holding the light in front of your monitor and casting a shadow on your divs). Had this effect ever been made into a script? To my surprise, there were very few scripts out there that did this. So I decided to try it <a href="http://codepen.io/jimmylorunning/pen/emEwWr">on Codepen</a>. It only took me about half an hour to do. I went through several other variations since then, but the basic idea is the same.</p>

<p>The next morning, I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about how awesome it would be if I could make it into a plugin. It could be my very first contribution to open source that people would actually use (because let&#39;s not kid ourselves, nobody&#39;s actually going to use my todo app! haha).</p>

<p>So I started reading about JQuery plugins to see what I&#39;d have to do to my code to make it into a pluggable part that people can just include. I also wanted it to be easily customizable. People can just use data-attributes on their div tags to change the properties of the shadow, how much it blurred, how fast it moved, etc. I definitely didn&#39;t want them to have to change my script in order to change the options. It should be like a function, you pass it arguments, and it did its thing.</p>

<p>Making my half hour script into a flexible plugin turned out to take me much longer than writing the basic script itself. But it was a great exercise in writing modifiable code! I had to think a lot about encapsulation and keeping variables inside the plugin separate from everything external. Finally, I had to create <a href="http://jimmylocoding.com/lilt/">a pretty page</a> to show off the capabilities of my plugin. Go <a href="http://jimmylocoding.com/lilt/">visit it now</a>! And let me know if you find it useful.</p>

<p>Future improvements (maybe):
<ul>
    <li>text shadows!</li>
    <li>maybe the blur value can change as you scroll as well?</li>
</ul></p>

          Week 6: Unexpected!

      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2015</span>

      <p>Last week was all about being overwhelmed. This week was all about the unexpected.
<ul>
    <li><strong>SaaS homework:</strong> I did not expect to spend 15 hours (more if you count the fact that I spent another 3 hours refactoring after I was done) on this assignment. It&#39;s definitely the most involved homework assignment so far (although there were a few in SaaS 1 that were pretty difficult too). I won&#39;t go into it in detail here because I already <a href="http://jimmylocoding.com/2015/01/29/saas-legacy-hw2-lessons-learned/">wrote a blogpost about it</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Exquisite Source:</strong> I did not expect to write <a href="https://still-sands-5922.herokuapp.com/about.php">this</a>. But I got inspired by an article on pull requests! And it was a very simple non-ambitious project technically speaking... with a (perhaps too) ambitious idea behind it. So we&#39;ll see if it takes off. Hopefully it helps someone. If it doesn&#39;t, it was only a couple hours of pretty fun work.</li>
    <li><strong>My first JQuery plugin</strong>? I will write a separate blog post about this soon. But umm... I wrote a JQuery plugin! And it&#39;s open source. And it was the last thing I expected to do this week, but I just got caught up in a very small idea that I thought others could re-use. More soon.</li>
</ul></p>

      <p>I had an idea this morning while <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/how-to-make-a-pull-request">reading about pull requests</a>: why not have a sandbox-like environment just for people to practice doing pull requests without the fear of messing anything up? And while we&#39;re at it, why not make it into a surrealist game, to see what kind of crazy franken-art will come out?</p>

<p>So I went ahead and made it a reality. Introducing <a href="https://still-sands-5922.herokuapp.com/about.php">Exquisite Source</a>! Please have a look around and make your first pull request!</p>
