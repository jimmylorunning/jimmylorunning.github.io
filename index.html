      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2015</span>

      <p>I&#39;m in the middle of a super long post about Rails models. It is quite involved and is taking a long time to write. So in the meantime, I present you with this relatively shorter blog post composed of mostly links.</p>

<p>I recently got a new MacBook Pro! So I spent a day installing and setting up my system for the perfect workflow. I experimented with different set ups, and ended up installing and un-installing several things. Also sometimes I&#39;d install something, and realize I had to install something else first, etc. So here I will try to just show you how I would do it if I had to do it again, without all the mistakes.</p>

<h3>The Terminal and the Shell</h3>

<ul>
<li>install <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/index.shtml">iTerm</a></li>
<li>install <a href="http://ohmyz.sh/">Oh My ZSH</a> because it&#39;s really cool looking!

<ul>
<li>move existing .bashrc content to .zshrc</li>
<li>move existing .bash_profile content to .zprofile</li>
<li>selectively add some of these <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/bash-aliases-mac-centos-linux-unix.html">shell aliases</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Get ALL OF THE PACKAGE MANAGERZZZ!</h3>

<ul>
<li>haha j/k, there are so many that it&#39;s confusing. I&#39;ll try to explain...

<ul>
<li>apt-get is a package manager for linux (don&#39;t need for my Mac--use homebrew instead)</li>
<li><a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> is a package manager for osx (the command is just <code>brew</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems">rubygems</a> is a package manager for ruby (the command is <code>gem</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm">npm</a> is a package manager for JavaScript, you&#39;ll need to install <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/">node.js</a> first</li>
<li><a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a> is a package manager for web packages (bootstrap, jquery, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>decidedly NOT package managers, but useful in some of the same ways:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a> can be used to download contents from FTP, HTTP and HTTPS (<code>brew install wget</code>)</li>
<li><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html">curl</a> is similar to wget, with <a href="http://daniel.haxx.se/docs/curl-vs-wget.html">some differences</a>. (comes with Mac, I think)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>tmux it up!</h3>

<ul>
<li>install tmux: <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/love-hate-tmux">simple instructions</a></li>
<li>optionally <a href="https://gist.github.com/snuggs/800936">configure tmux based on this gist</a></li>
<li>set up shell so that it <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Tmux#Start_tmux_on_every_shell_login">starts tmux by default</a></li>
<li><a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course">learn more</a> about tmux</li>
</ul>

<h3>Git, GitHub, etc.</h3>

<ul>
<li>set up XCode and git (I just typed <code>git</code> and it asked me if I wanted to install XCode etc., so easy)</li>
<li>generate <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">ssh key for github</a></li>
<li>added alias for <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/lab_11.html">git hist</a> </li>
<li>optionally install <a href="http://gitx.frim.nl/">GitX</a> or <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Source Tree</a> for GUI visualization</li>
</ul>

<h3>Set up localhost</h3>

<ul>
<li>set up <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3083">localhost with userdir</a>

<ul>
<li>user pages at ~/Sites (accessible at localhost/~jimmy/...)</li>
<li>localhost at /Library/WebServer/Documents (or ~www/Documents) and accessible at localhost</li>
<li>had to do &quot;chmod -R o+w ~www/Documents&quot; in order to get write access to this folder</li>
<li><a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/abbe">linked</a> /wwwd to ~www/Documents so I can just do &#39;cd /wwwd&#39; or &#39;/wwwd&#39; in zsh</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Edit Them Texts!</h3>

<ul>
<li>no need to install vim (comes with Mac), but it&#39;s nice to configure vim:

<ul>
<li>install <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen</a> which allows us to...</li>
<li>install <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible">Vim Sensible</a> (universal set of defaults)</li>
<li>and <a href="https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized">Solarized</a> (pretty colors!)</li>
<li>note: if your colors don&#39;t look right, add <code>let g:solarized_termcolors = 256</code> to your ~/.vimrc file as <a href="http://fideloper.com/mac-vim-tmux">detailed here</a> (scroll down to &quot;Add Solarized&quot;)</li>
<li>added some <a href="https://gist.github.com/jimmylorunning/196d21cca3e6233be90b">tab settings into .vimrc</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>install <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html">linked subl</a> so it can be used on the command line</li>
</ul>

<h3>Set up Rails</h3>

<ul>
<li>install <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.10-yosemite">rbenv, ruby, rails, mysql, and postgresql</a></li>
<li>install <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com/osx">heroku toolbelt</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>PHP, if you absolutely must</h3>

<ul>
<li>PHP came with my Mac! (type <code>php -v</code> to see if you have it first) but I still had to <a href="http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-phpmyadmin-working-osx-10-10-yosemite/">configure it</a> (scroll down to PHP).</li>
<li>if you already installed Rails via instructions above, then you&#39;ll have MySQL... now all you&#39;ll need is <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php">phpmyadmin</a>. Use <a href="http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-phpmyadmin-working-osx-10-10-yosemite/">these instructions</a> (search for phpmyadmin)</li>
<li>install PHPUnit (testing framework) with <a href="https://phpunit.de/getting-started.html">these instructions</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Jekyll or this blog didn&#39;t happen!</h3>

<ul>
<li>instructions here <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Jekyll</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Super Useful Tools!</h3>

<ul>
<li>install <a href="http://www.ricciadams.com/projects/pixel-winch">Pixel Winch</a> SUPER easily measure anything in pixels</li>
<li>install <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> read docs on Ruby, JavaScript, etc. even if you&#39;re offline</li>
<li>install <a href="http://mizage.com/divvy/">Divvy</a> manage your windows</li>
<li>install <a href="http://www.colordiff.org/">colordiff</a> <code>brew install colordiff</code> and alias diff=&quot;colordiff&quot; in ~./zshrc</li>
<li>install <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> for password management</li>
<li>install <a href="http://todotxt.com/">todo.txt</a> command line todo list tool!</li>
</ul>

<p>Phew! Did I miss anything? Do you have any suggestions? Let me know!</p>

          My First Code Retreat!
        </a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2015</span>

      <p>This past weekend I went to my very first code retreat! &quot;What is a code retreat?&quot; you may be asking yourself. Don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t know what it was either until very recently. Here&#39;s an intro from the event&#39;s sign up page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of &#39;getting things done&#39;, the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.</p>

<p>More specifically,  individuals are are grouped into teams of two and each team “solves” a common problem, &#39;The Game of Life&#39;.  There are 6 sessions throughout the day and for each session the groups are reorganized and the code deleted.  After each session there are session reflections to help with the  internalization of lessons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s basically a day of learning and exploring with awesome people and no judgment. So pretty much the best thing ever.</p>

<p>The event I went to was hosted at <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/">Big Nerd Ranch</a> and lead by <a href="http://kyfast.net/">Kylie Stradley</a> and <a href="http://srbiv.github.io/">Stafford Brooke</a>, and also sponsored by <a href="https://mandrill.com/">Mandrill</a> and <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a>.</p>

<p>After a breakfast of gourmet donuts, Kylie introduced us to the problem we were to solve for the rest of the day: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">The Game of Life</a>. The game explores the complexities that arise from a set of very simple rules. And because of its simple rules, it makes for a great software design exercise.</p>

<p>The point was not to write working code, but to explore different possible ways of writing it. The fun came in the variation of solutions, and the explorations of the pros/cons of each.</p>

<p>It reminded me of an exercise I gave myself when I was first exploring the beauty and subtlety of writing. The exercise was simple: pick any sentence and write it 20 or 30 different times using different sentence structures, wording, punctuation or grammar without changing the primary meaning. For example, the sentence &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot; could also be written as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being quick, the brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>

<p>The lazy dog was jumped over by the quick brown fox.</p>

<p>Because the fox is lazy, the quick brown fox jumps over him.</p>

<p>The fox (quick and brown) jumps over the lazy dog.</p>

<p>Over the lazy dog the quick brown fox jumps!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(This was the type of fun I had in high school hahaha) The other part of this exercise, and arguably the more important part, is to take each sentence and analyze it for how it differs from the original in terms of tone, voice, connotation, emphasis, meaning, etc. I say this is the more important part of the exercise because reflection leads to awareness and understanding of what each tweak does to the original. This kind of obsession eventually lead me to become a poet, so if this looks fun to you: beware! A life of agonizing over words awaits you.</p>

<p>Code retreat reminded me of doing this same exercise, but with code! We were given just enough time to formulate a solution, without enough time to finish or perfect it. That way, we weren&#39;t expected to finish anything, and so we could concentrate on issues of design.</p>

<p>We paired with a new person for each session, and by the end of the day we would have paired with almost everybody in the room. For each session, we were also expected to practice test driven development (this made it even harder to complete in 45 minutes, but added the dimension of very intentional forethought and planning).</p>

<p>Many of us had never tackled the game of life problem before, so the first session was basically dedicated to getting comfortable with the problem space. But with each subsequent session, we were given new constraints. Imagine if doing the sentence exercise above, I had given myself rules for each sentence, like &quot;must use a passive verb&quot; or &quot;must have a dependent clause&quot;. These constraints stretched us and made us think about the problem in a new way.</p>

<p>We had a diverse group of experts and beginners. Rather than try to make everyone program in one language, we were encouraged to learn from each other. Thus, I got to program with a C# programmer, an iOS developer, and someone with JavaScript and Go experience, as well as people who didn&#39;t have much programming experience (but rich experiences in other fields).</p>

<p>At the end of each session, we were encouraged to delete our code. This re-inforced the idea that the code was not the goal, but what we learned from designing it. After each session, we also reconvened with the larger group to talk about what we learned and how we approached the problem and share ideas. This part was super helpful and eye-opening, because some teams came up with very unexpected and inventive designs.</p>

<p>One of the things we talked about was whether the logic of the cell living or dying should go into the board or the cell. There were good arguments on both sides, and at the end of the day I had attempted it both ways and am <em>still</em> undecided about which way is better. As with everything, it&#39;s a matter of understanding tradeoffs.</p>

<h3>Looking Back</h3>

<p>If I could do code retreat all over again, I would try not to design the entire game every time. Instead, figure out what the constraint is getting me to reconsider, and only design/program that part. For example, we had a constraint where we couldn&#39;t use if statements. The method that it would affect most would be the main logic of the program--whether a cell lives or dies.</p>

<p>But we ended up on several tangents, spending a lot of time talking about other aspects of the program, like different ways of seeding it, or how to find neighboring cells and such. And because we only had 45 minutes, I didn&#39;t feel like I got enough time to really explore the main issues of that exercise. If I could do it again, I would have just hardcoded a method that returned the same number of neighbors every time, just so that I didn&#39;t have to think about that part, and could focus on the really good parts of that exercise.</p>

<h3>Looking Forward</h3>

<p>Coderetreat was a great experience, and I loved meeting people in the spirit of learning. Everyone was kind and helpful, and the ideas we shared will continue to help me in my everyday work. But this is just the beginning:</p>

<p>Global Day of Coderetreat is November 15! I&#39;m already looking forward to the next one, and so should you. There is <a href="http://coderetreat.org/">a website</a> where you can look for coderetreats in your area. But if there isn&#39;t one, you should organize one! The website provides all the details you&#39;ll need to organize your very own.</p>

      <p><img src="/images/git.png" align="right">Not so long ago, I was learning Git for the first time. I was going through tutorials and picking it up pretty quickly. No big deal, right? I understood the basic concept of version control, and I can type simple commands. The problem is that whenever I used git outside of those tutorials and ideal situations, I got stuck because I didn&#39;t understand how it worked behind the scenes.</p>

<p>There are many tutorials that go through the motions of using git without telling you how to think about what&#39;s going on. On the other hand, resources that teach you how to think about git aren&#39;t nearly as prevalent as those beginner tutorials that teach you what to type. So here are three of the most useful resources that helped me level up on git beyond the very basics.</p>

<h3>Think Like a Git</h3>

<p><a href="http://think-like-a-git.net/">Think Like a Git</a> is a website dedicated to that &quot;aha&quot; moment. Do you think there&#39;s something magical about git? There really isn&#39;t. It&#39;s just that you don&#39;t have a mental model of git yet, so everything that happens seems like magic and kind of mysterious. Reading this tutorial was enlightening and really put me on the track of being comfortable with git, even when I messed up and didn&#39;t follow a normal workflow.</p>

<h3>Git for Ages 4 and Up</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4">Git for Ages 4 and Up</a> Michael Schwern walks you through adding, committing, pushing, and a whole bunch of other git commands while playing with Tinkertoys! The visual element really makes this a wonderful resource. Unfortunately, the video isn&#39;t of the highest quality, and there are a lot of interuptions and tangents. But overall, it&#39;s really helpful.</p>

<h3>Git Happens</h3>

<p>Jessica Kerr <a href="http://twitter.com/jessitron">@jessitron</a> is a great speaker and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv8I_kfrFWw">Git Happens</a>, she not only leads us through a few more difficult commands but also helps us understand <em>why</em> git is hard, and why it&#39;s worth it. I loved how she talked about how git not only allows you to save your work, but also allows you to tell the story of what you did any way you like. Please note that Jessica actually prefers <a href="https://vimeo.com/46010208">this version</a> of her talk, but the one above was the one that I originally watched (and I still prefer it).</p>

<h3>A few visualization tools</h3>

<p>I haven&#39;t really used many of these extensively, but since we&#39;re talking about visualizing and mental models, these can come in handy:</p>

          Jekyll & Hyde

      <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2015</span>

      <p>If you&#39;re a longtime reader (as in, the 2 months that this blog has been in existence), you may have noticed some changes. That&#39;s because I just changed blogging platforms from WordPress to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<h3>Why Change?</h3>

<p>In January, I was learning some new things (Rails, Ruby, Agile, etc.) and I had no time to customize a blog the way I liked it. Nevertheless, I needed some place to document what I&#39;ve learned and connect with people. So I decided to put up a blog as quickly as possible. The only requirement was that it must take almost no time to set up. I was already familiar with WordPress, and have set up several WordPress blogs before. So I set it up, downloaded a free theme, and voila! I was in business.</p>

<p>Two and a half months later, I still like my blog a lot, but it looked cluttered. I started to admire a lot of the other blogs for their minimalistic beauty. The content was front and center. Most of these blogs were hosted on either Ghost, Medium, or GitHub Pages. I decided to look into these options.</p>

<h3>Why GitHub Pages? Why Jekyll?</h3>

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is hosted on GitHub. You automatically get one site per GitHub account, and when you push any changes to it, it gets updated. No further work needed! I was attracted mostly to the convenience of updating the blog where I would update my other code--in my text editor. It reminded me of the early days when the internet was just a bunch of static HTML pages, and I&#39;d log into the server to edit my HTML files directly. On top of GitHub pages, you get Jekyll:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll behind the scenes, so in addition to supporting regular HTML content, they’re also a great way to host your Jekyll-powered website for free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jekyll is so cool! With it, I can write all my posts within my text editor using beautiful <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/">Markdown</a> instead of ugly HTML or dealing with buggy WYSIWYG interfaces! GitHub Pages and Jekyll provides all the advantages of a static site (speed, simplicity) with all the advantages of a dynamic site (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY-ness</a>). Every time you push the site, Jekyll generates all the static pages for you based on the templates and code you&#39;ve written. So despite the fact that it&#39;s a static site, if you want to change the layout or colors or even functionality of your site, you can do it in just one place.</p>

<p>Jekyll works with regular HTML pages too, so I didn&#39;t have to convert all my old posts to Markdown.</p>

<p>Here are the other advantages of using GitHub Pages / Jekyll:</p>

<ul>
<li>since content is static instead of in a database, all my blog content is version controlled and backed up on GitHub</li>
<li>static pages mean non-executable and secure pages! I don&#39;t have to worry about someone hacking into my blog if I didn&#39;t update to the latest WordPress release</li>
<li>design-wise, it is so simple. I can do anything I want to the site, it&#39;s simply a matter of changing HTML, Markdown, and CSS files</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting it up</h3>

<p>There&#39;s nothing that technically extraordinary about my set-up that I need to write a whole blog post about it. I followed <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/">this tutorial</a>, but instead of only using <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">Poole</a>, I also used a Poole theme called <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde</a>. The difference? Poole isn&#39;t exactly a theme; it comes with all types of default settings on top of Jekyll to give you a solid foundation to build upon. Hyde, on the other hand, <i>is</i> a theme and is built on top of Poole.</p>

<p>The second tutorial I used was <a href="http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/">this blog post</a> which helped me implement tags.</p>

<h3>Downsides</h3>

<p>The only downside is that I&#39;ve now lost all of the great comments you&#39;ve left on my blog. I still <i>have</i> them, of course. But they are no longer on this version of the blog for everyone to see. But since I&#39;ve implemented comments using <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, it will be pretty easy for you to leave comments on this site from here on out. You don&#39;t even need a Disqus account, as you can use OAuth to log in through Twitter or any of the other social networks.</p>

<h3>One additional note</h3>

<p>OK maybe two. First, the related_posts method that comes with Jekyll is sorely lacking. Luckily, I was able to find <a href="http://www.chrisyin.com/2014/08/23/jekyll-related-posts/">a plugin</a> for it, and since Jekyll is written in Ruby, plugins are just Ruby classes that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patch</a> existing classes. This means that if I didn&#39;t like this plugin, I could change it without having to learn a new language.</p>

<p>Second, and this is the unfortunate part, GitHub Pages disables all plugins by default, for security reasons. So even though the related posts and tags plugins work fine on my local Jekyll server, it doesn&#39;t work when pushed to GitHub.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the workaround: When you run Jekyll, it generates a static site. When you push to GitHub, GitHub Pages knows to run Jekyll on those files and publish the static files that it generates. But we don&#39;t want GitHub to run Jekyll for us because its version of Jekyll ignores plugins. We want to run our own Jekyll and tell GitHub to use our own statically generated pages instead!</p>

<p>So what we need are two repos. One to hold the Jekyll site, and one to hold our own statically generated site.</p>

<p>This second repo <i>must</i> be named github-username.github.io because that&#39;s how GitHub Pages knows its the repo to publish. So what I had to do was rename the current jimmylorunning.github.io repo to jimmylocoding.com. This will be the first repo mentioned above.</p>

<p>For the second repo, I go to GitHub and create one named jimmylorunning.github.io. I go to my local _site folder (which is where Jekyll stores the statically generated site) and type <code>git init</code>. I add all the files, commit them, and push to jimmylorunning.github.io as its origin. From now on, whenever I make any changes to my blog, I will have to commit my jekyll files to the jimmylocoding.com repo, run <code>jekyll serve</code> or <code>jekyll build</code> (which I should run anyway, just to test my changes before pushing), then commit all my generated _site files to jimmylorunning.github.io.</p>
